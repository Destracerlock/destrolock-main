# Active Theme Images

This folder is intentionally text-only in Git to avoid binary-file PR issues.

When you run:

```bash
python3 projects/lensflow-chrome-theme/scripts/apply-selection.py /path/to/selection.json
```

it will create/update these runtime files locally:

- `ntp-background.jpg`
- `frame.jpg`
